### üíª About  

The Weather Application API provides real-time weather forecasts for cities globally. This service is designed to be efficient and robust, utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

## üõ† Features

- [X] **Real-Time Weather Forecasts**: Retrieve up-to-the-minute weather information for any valid city worldwide.
- [X] **Flexible Forecast Options**: Users can request weather forecasts for the next 3 or 5 days.
- [X] **In-memory Database**: Integration with H2 database for lightweight data management and quick setup without the need for external database servers.

## üöÄ Technology Stack

- **Spring Boot**: Simplifies the development of new Spring applications through convention over configuration.
- **H2 Database**: A lightweight in-memory database, perfect for development and testing environments.
- **JUnit 5**: The latest generation of the standard framework in Java for unit testing with built-in support for parameterized tests.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and project lifecycle management.
- **Spring HATEOAS**: Enables the creation of REST APIs that follow the HATEOAS principle, making the API more discoverable and self-descriptive by including hypermedia links with responses.
- **ControllerAdvice**: Centralizes exception handling in Spring Boot applications, allowing for consistent and clean error handling across all controllers.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Setup and Installation

- Java 17 or newer
- Maven
- An IDE of your choice (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

3. **Environment Variables Configuration Guide**

## List of Environment Variables

### Application Configuration

- **SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME**: The name of the Spring Boot application.
- **SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL**: JDBC URL for connecting to the database.
- **SPRING_DATASOURCE_DRIVERCLASSNAME**: The class name of the JDBC driver.
- **SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME**: Username for database access.
- **SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD**: Password for database access.
- **SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO**: Hibernate configuration for schema management.
- **WEATHER_API_URL**: Base URL for the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **WEATHER_API_KEY**: API key for authenticating requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Setting Environment Variables

### macOS/Linux

Open your terminal and input the following commands to set the environment variables for the session:

```bash
export SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME=weather
export SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
export SPRING_DATASOURCE_DRIVERCLASSNAME=org.h2.Driver
export SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=sa
export SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=
export SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO=update
export WEATHER_API_URL=https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/
export WEATHER_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### Windows

```bash
set SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME=weather
set SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
set SPRING_DATASOURCE_DRIVERCLASSNAME=org.h2.Driver
set SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=sa
set SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=
set SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO=update
set WEATHER_API_URL=https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/
set WEATHER_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### Configuring Environment Variables in IntelliJ IDEA üõ†Ô∏è

When developing with IntelliJ IDEA, it's straightforward to set up environment variables directly in your IDE. Follow these steps to configure your environment variables within IntelliJ IDEA:

1. **Open Your Project**: Start IntelliJ IDEA and open your project where the Spring Boot application is located.

2. **Edit Configurations**: Navigate to the **Run** menu at the top of the IDE, then select **Edit Configurations...** from the dropdown menu.

3. **Select Your Application**: In the left panel of the Run/Debug Configurations dialog, select your Spring Boot application configuration. If it‚Äôs not already there, you may need to add it by clicking the `+` icon and selecting **Spring Boot**.

4. **Set Environment Variables**: In the configuration settings, find the **Environment variables** field. Click the browse button (the icon with three dots) to open the **Environment Variables** dialog.

5. **Enter the Variables**: In the dialog that appears, you can add your environment variables. Use a semicolon `;` to separate different variables. Here is an example of how to format them:

```bash
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=sa;SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=;SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO=update;WEATHER_API_URL=https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/;WEATHER_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## Running the Application without Environment Variables Inline

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

### Inline Environment Variable Setting

You can run the Spring Boot application using the following command in your terminal. This command temporarily sets the environment variables just for the duration of the application session:

```bash
SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME=weather \
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb \
SPRING_DATASOURCE_DRIVERCLASSNAME=org.h2.Driver \
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=sa \
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD= \
SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO=update \
WEATHER_API_URL=https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/ \
WEATHER_API_KEY=your-api-key-here \
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## üìÇ Project Architecture Overview

The `com.pt.weather` package of our Weather Application is structured to clearly separate concerns, promote modularity, and enhance maintainability. Below is an overview of each package and its purpose within the application:

### üìÅ `config`
- **Purpose**: Contains classes for configuration settings that customize the behavior of the Spring Boot application.

### üìÅ `controller`
- **Purpose**: Houses the controller classes responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and sending responses back to the client.

### üìÅ `exception`
- **Purpose**: Includes classes for handling exceptions throughout the application.
  - üìÅ `advice`
    - **ApiException, CityNotFoundException, InvalidCityException**: Custom exceptions that handle specific error scenarios, making error responses more informative and useful.

### üìÅ `model`
- **Purpose**: Contains domain models used throughout the application.
  - üìÅ `dto`
     Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) facilitate the transfer of data between processes, enhancing data encapsulation and API abstraction.

### üìÅ `repository`
- **Purpose**: Encapsulates the logic required to access data sources, acting as a bridge between the database and the business logic.

### üìÅ `service`
- **Purpose**: Core service layer that contains business logic.
  - üìÅ `impl`
    - **CityService, CityValidationService, ForecastService**: Interfaces defining the contracts for services. Their implementations handle specific business rules and data transformations.

### üìÅ `util`
- **Purpose**: Utilities and helpers that provide cross-cutting functionalities.


## üåê High-Level Functionality

- The **Controller** layer handles HTTP requests and delegates business processing to the Service layer.
- The **Service** layer contains business logic and interacts with the Repository layer to fetch and store data.
- The **Repository** layer abstracts the data access technology and provides methods to query and manipulate data in the database.
- **Exception Handling** is centralized in the `exception` package, allowing for cleaner controllers and service methods.
- **Configuration** settings are managed centrally to configure aspects like database connectivity, security, and custom behaviors.

By maintaining this organized structure, our application ensures that each component has a single responsibility, aligns with the SOLID principles, and promotes easier testing and maintenance.
